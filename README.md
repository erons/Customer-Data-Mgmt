# Technical Demo: Customer Data Management

The target was to explore the flexibility and utility of the Vue.js Framework for Frontend application development, to see if it was a valid alternative to established options like Angular.js and React.js.
As well as it's usability with a back end solution, for which we chose the SLIM framework - mainly for it's supposed ease of use as a micro php framework to enable quick development of Rest API.
As a result, we went with a web application for Customer Data Management, developed as a Minimum Viable Product.  


## Development Toolchain
- Vue.js - JavaScript Framework for web front-end development.
- MySQL -  Relational Database to host data (structured) resources
- Slim -   php micro framework used to write the API for the backend
- Apache 2.0 - used in hosting the backend service (API)
- Bootstrap - provided UI templates (Navbar, Icons, Buttons)
- Swagger Editor - for documenting the API


## Team
